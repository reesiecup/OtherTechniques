# Texas Doula
I started this project because I was dying to know the key factors determining a doula's pricing. We were considering to hire a doula for our first baby, but we were extremely confused by what an reasonable price should be for a doula that meets all of our needs. I thought I would scrape some data to analyze how doulas (in Texas area) price themselves, hence this project was born. I got to sharp my skills on web-scraping using Pyton package BeautifulSoup. Interestingly, I noticed that I kept getting blocked by the website. To get around it, I used Python package Stem and it actually worked.

However, I was doing some research about web-scraping at the same time, and I stumbled upon this article **Web Scraping and Crawling Are Perfectly Legal, Right?** (https://benbernardblog.com/web-scraping-and-crawling-are-perfectly-legal-right/). This article has changed my views and my practices on data science projects significantly, and I decided to not continue this project.
